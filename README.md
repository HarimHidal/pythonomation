# pythonomation
This is a repo for my own python scripts that I use to automate day-to-day activities. The tasks performed include:
- Clases: opening the files, directories and zoom meetings for my online classes at startup given a schedule in a Word document.
- Cumples: check if it's the birthday of one of my friends and get all ready to send then a HBD message. 
- Descargas: manage my downloads directory to move files in batches as it was a common task I performed everyday. 
- Macro Recorder: record all the keystrokes and mouse clicks for later execution. Just like a macro but way simpler.
- PDF Merger: merge a batch of PDF files into one. It's very useful for adding covers to documents and assignments.

Note:
- You may need to install some of the python modules in your machine to run the scripts, to do so, you can use: pip install [ name of the module ]
